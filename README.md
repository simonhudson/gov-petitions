# gov-petitions
Experimenting with publicly available data from petition.parliament.uk

## What we're doing
* Make call to get petition data (by ID)
* Handle return (either error or display data)
* Poll every [x] seconds

## Nice-to-have
* New signatures appear at top of list and are marked when they arrive (flash green or suchlike)
